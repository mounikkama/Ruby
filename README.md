# Ruby Code Challenge

# Introduction

This repsetive provide project contains a Ruby script (`challenge.rb`) that processes by loading the respective user & company data from `users.json` and `companies.json`.
The script calculates token top-ups for active users based on their companyâ€™s top-up value and generates an `output.txt` file with the respective results.

# Key Features:

- Calculates and updates token balances for active users.
- Differentiates between users who should receive an email and those who should not based on company and user email status.
- Outputs the result in the format specified in the `example_output.txt`.
- Handles potential bad data by safely fetching fields with default values to avoid crashes.
